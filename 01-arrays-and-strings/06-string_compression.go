// Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of
// repeated characters for example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.
// If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string,
// your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has
// only uper case and lower case letters (a-z).
