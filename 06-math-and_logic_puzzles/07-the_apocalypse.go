// In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately
// concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all
// families should ensure that they have one girl or else they face
// massive fines. If all families abide by this policy-that is,
// they have continue to have children until they have one girl, at which
// point they immediately stop-what will the gender ratio of the new
// generation be? (Assume that the odds of someone having a boy or a girl
// on any given pregnancy is equal.) Solve this out logically and then
// write a computer simulation of it
