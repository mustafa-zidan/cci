// There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the
// probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start
// walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly
// picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be
// chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
//
// Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex
// polygon.
